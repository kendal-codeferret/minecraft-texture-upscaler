# minecraft-texture-upscaler
Scales the minecraft assets to 
be 4 of the same image. To use 
it just run the executable. The 
path you input needs to be to 
whatever folder the "assets" 
subfolder is in (the full path).

It's not completely finished yet 
and there are a lot of things I 
need to do, but if you find 
anything that I don't have in my 
list yet feel free to tell me.
